# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project analyzes the famous Titanic dataset to understand factors that influenced passenger survival. Using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the notebook explores patterns across gender, age, class, embarkation point, and other key features.

## 📌 Key Steps in the Analysis

### 1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
- Inspected dataset structure  
- Checked missing values and duplicates  
- Understood key columns and data types  

### 2. **Data Cleaning**
- Handled missing data (`Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`)  
- Converted data types where necessary  
- Created new features (if applicable)

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Survival distribution by:
  - Gender  
  - Passenger Class (Pclass)  
  - Age groups  
  - Fare ranges  
  - Embarkation point  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Count plots and histograms

## 📈 Insights & Findings
- Females had a significantly higher survival rate than males  
- Higher-class passengers (1st class) survived more than lower-class passengers  
- Younger passengers tended to survive at higher rates  
- Embarkation location played a role in survival likelihood
